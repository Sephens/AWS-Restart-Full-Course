# Transitioning a Data Center to the Cloud

## What You Will Learn

### At the Core of the Lesson
You will walk through an example of transitioning a data center to the cloud. You will:
1. Learn about the components and characteristics of a corporate data center.
2. Explore how to set up and run a similar environment on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Corporate Data Center Example

### Traditional On-Premises Infrastructure
A traditional corporate data center typically follows a **three-tier, client-server architecture**. The diagram below represents a typical setup:

- **Database Tier:** Includes primary and secondary databases with tape backup storage.
- **Application Tier:** Contains application servers and network-attached storage (NAS) for file sharing.
- **Web Tier:** Includes web servers and load balancers for distributing traffic.

**Components:**
- **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming network traffic across backend servers.
- **Web Servers:** Handle presentation logic.
- **Application Servers:** Provide middleware services, business logic, and data access.
- **NAS Servers:** Centralized file storage for network users.
- **Primary and Secondary Databases:** Store and manage data.
- **Tape Backup Storage:** Used for data backup.
- **Microsoft Active Directory or LDAP Server:** Manages user authentication and resource access.
- **Storage Area Network (SAN):** High-speed network for block-level storage access.

## Corporate Data Center Example: Discussion

### Cloud Computing Advantages
In a previous lesson, you learned about the advantages of cloud computing. Consider how these benefits apply to transitioning a data center to the cloud:

1. **Trade Upfront Costs for Variable Costs:** Stop buying hardware and pay only for what you use.
2. **Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale:** Leverage AWS's purchasing power to reduce costs.
3. **Eliminate Guessing Capacity Needs:** Use scaling to create flexible, highly available solutions.
4. **Increase Speed and Agility:** Deploy and decommission resources with a few clicks.
5. **Stop Spending on Data Center Maintenance:** Focus on your core business instead of managing infrastructure.
6. **Go Global in Minutes:** Deploy applications worldwide with minimal effort.

## Activity: Transitioning a Corporate Data Center

### Objective
Using what you have learned about AWS core services and architecture best practices, migrate the corporate data center to the cloud.

### Steps
1. **Whiteboard the Diagram:** In small groups, draw the corporate data center diagram.
2. **Replace Components with AWS Services:** Identify which AWS services can replace each on-premises component.
3. **Discuss with the Class:** Share your findings and discuss the transition process.

## Corporate Data Center Transition Considerations

### On-Premises Components and AWS Replacements
| On-Premises Item | AWS Service or Resource |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Servers          | Amazon EC2 Instances    |
| LDAP Server      | AWS Directory Service   |
| Software-based Load Balancers | Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) |
| SAN Solutions    | Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) |
| NAS File Server  | Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) |
| Databases        | Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) |
| Tape Backup Storage | Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) |

## Transitioning a Corporate Data Center to the Cloud

### AWS Services for Each Component
1. **Servers (Web and App Servers):** Replace with **Amazon EC2 Instances**.
   - EC2 instances can run various operating systems (Windows Server, Linux, etc.) and host server applications.
   
2. **LDAP Server:** Replace with **AWS Directory Service**.
   - Supports LDAP authentication and integrates with Microsoft Active Directory.

3. **Load Balancers:** Replace with **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**.
   - ELB automatically scales and performs health checks on backend resources.

4. **SAN Solutions:** Replace with **Amazon EBS**.
   - EBS provides block-level storage for EC2 instances, suitable for long-term data storage.

5. **NAS File Server:** Replace with **Amazon EFS**.
   - EFS offers scalable file storage for EC2 instances, automatically adjusting storage size as needed.

6. **Databases:** Replace with **Amazon RDS**.
   - RDS supports multiple database engines (Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and is fully managed by AWS.

7. **Tape Backup Storage:** Replace with **Amazon S3**.
   - S3 provides object storage with versioning and automatic backups.

## Corporate Data Center Example on AWS

### Diagram of the Transitioned Data Center
After transitioning to AWS, the data center might look like this:

- **ELB Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic to EC2 instances running web servers.
- **AWS Directory Service:** Replaces the LDAP server.
- **Amazon EBS:** Replaces SAN solutions for block storage.
- **Amazon EFS:** Replaces the NAS file server for scalable file storage.
- **Amazon RDS:** Replaces the primary and secondary databases.
- **Amazon S3:** Replaces tape backup storage for object storage.

## Checkpoint Questions

1. **Which AWS services can organizations use to transition a data center to the cloud?**
   - Organizations can transition components of traditional data centers to AWS services by selecting the appropriate service to fulfill the business need. For example:
     - Replace traditional web servers with **Amazon EC2 Instances**.
     - Replace LDAP with **AWS Directory Service**.
     - Replace software-based load balancers with **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**.
     - Replace SAN solutions with **Amazon EBS**.
     - Replace NAS file servers with **Amazon EFS**.
     - Replace databases with **Amazon RDS**.
     - Replace tape backup storage with **Amazon S3**.

2. **What are some of the benefits of transitioning a data center to the cloud?**
   - **Trade upfront costs for variable costs:** Stop buying hardware and pay only for what you use.
   - **Benefit from massive economies of scale:** Leverage AWS's purchasing power to reduce costs.
   - **Eliminate guessing capacity needs:** Use scaling to create flexible, highly available solutions.
   - **Increase speed and agility:** Deploy and decommission resources with a few clicks.
   - **Stop spending on data center maintenance:** Focus on your core business instead of managing infrastructure.
   - **Go global in minutes:** Deploy applications worldwide with minimal effort.

3. **Which AWS service can replace a data center SAN system?**
   - **Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)** can replace a data center SAN system.
