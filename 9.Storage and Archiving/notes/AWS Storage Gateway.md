## Introduction to AWS Storage Gateway

**Definition**: AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises environments with AWS cloud storage, providing seamless integration between local IT environments and AWS storage infrastructure.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Hybrid Storage**: Bridges on-premises and cloud storage
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Supports file (NFS/SMB), volume (iSCSI), and tape (VTL) protocols
- **Data Protection**: Provides durable storage in AWS cloud
- **Caching**: Optimizes performance with local caching

**Example**: A manufacturing company uses Storage Gateway to extend their on-premises storage capacity while maintaining low-latency access to frequently used files.

## How Storage Gateway Works

### Architecture Overview:
```
On-Premises Environment
├── Applications
│   ├── File-based (NFS/SMB)
│   ├── Block-based (iSCSI)
│   └── Tape-based (VTL)
│
└── Storage Gateway
    ├── Virtual Machine or Hardware Appliance
    └── Local Cache

AWS Cloud
├── Storage Gateway Service
└── AWS Storage Services
    ├── Amazon S3
    ├── Amazon S3 Glacier
    ├── Amazon EBS
    └── Amazon FSx
```

**Data Flow**:
1. On-premises applications access storage via standard protocols
2. Gateway caches frequently accessed data locally
3. Data is asynchronously replicated to AWS storage services
4. Cloud storage becomes durable backend for on-premises data

## Key Features

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Protocol Support** | NFS, SMB, iSCSI, VTL | Works with existing applications |
| **Caching** | Automatic caching of active data | Low-latency access to hot data |
| **Bandwidth Optimization** | Compression and differential sync | Reduced network usage |
| **Encryption** | SSL/TLS in transit, AES-256 at rest | Enterprise-grade security |
| **Deployment Options** | VM or hardware appliance | Flexible installation |

**Example Configuration**:
```bash
# Deploying the Storage Gateway VM
aws storagegateway activate-gateway \
  --gateway-name my-gateway \
  --gateway-timezone GMT-5:00 \
  --gateway-region us-east-1 \
  --gateway-type FILE_S3
```

## Gateway Types

### 1. **File Gateway**
- **Protocols**: NFS v3/v4.1, SMB
- **Backend Storage**: Amazon S3/FSx
- **Use Case**: Cloud-backed file shares
- **Example**: 
  ```bash
  aws storagegateway create-nfs-file-share \
    --gateway-arn arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:123456789012:gateway/sgw-12A3456B \
    --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/StorageGatewayS3Role \
    --location-arn arn:aws:s3:::my-file-bucket
  ```

### 2. **Volume Gateway**
- **Modes**: Cached (primary in S3) or Stored (primary on-prem)
- **Backend**: EBS snapshots
- **Use Case**: Block storage for databases
- **Snapshot Example**:
  ```bash
  aws storagegateway create-snapshot \
    --volume-arn arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:123456789012:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABB \
    --snapshot-description "Monthly DB Backup"
  ```

### 3. **Tape Gateway**
- **Interface**: Virtual Tape Library (VTL)
- **Backend**: S3 + Glacier
- **Use Case**: Backup archival
- **Tape Archive Example**:
  ```bash
  aws storagegateway create-tapes \
    --gateway-arn arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:123456789012:gateway/sgw-12A3456B \
    --tape-size 107374182400 \ # 100GB
    --client-token "unique-string" \
    --num-tapes-to-create 5
  ```

### 4. **FSx File Gateway**
- **Specialization**: Native Windows file shares
- **Backend**: Amazon FSx for Windows
- **Use Case**: Active Directory integrated file shares

---

## Use Cases

1. **Backup and Archive**:
   - Tape Gateway replaces physical tapes with virtual tapes in S3/Glacier
   - Example: Commvault backup to virtual tapes with 7-year retention

2. **Storage Tiering**:
   - File Gateway automatically moves cold data to S3-IA/Glacier
   - Example: Media company keeps active projects locally, archives to S3

3. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Volume Gateway maintains EBS snapshots for quick recovery
   - Example: 15-minute RTO for critical SAP systems

4. **Cloud Migration**:
   - Gradual migration of file shares to S3/FSx
   - Example: 50TB fileserver migration over 6 months

5. **Low-Latency Access**:
   - Local cache provides fast access to cloud data
   - Example: CAD designers working with files stored in S3

## Checkpoint Questions & Answers

1. **What are the four Storage Gateway types?**
   - **Answer**:
     1. S3 File Gateway
     2. FSx File Gateway
     3. Volume Gateway
     4. Tape Gateway

2. **What are the two ways to deploy the on-premises component of Storage Gateway?**
   - **Answer**:
     - Virtual Machine (VM) on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or Linux KVM
     - Hardware appliance (Storage Gateway hardware solution)

3. **A systems administrator wants to archive the log files of an on-premises database to the AWS Cloud and store them for the lowest cost. Which Storage Gateway type should the administrator choose?**
   - **Answer**: **Tape Gateway**, as it supports direct archiving to S3 Glacier Deep Archive (lowest cost storage class) through virtual tape ejection.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hybrid Flexibility**: Enables gradual cloud adoption while maintaining on-premises access
2. **Protocol Compatibility**: Works with existing applications using standard protocols
3. **Cost Optimization**: Reduces on-premises storage costs through cloud tiering
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Provides cloud-backed protection for on-premises data
5. **Deployment Options**: Supports both virtual and hardware deployments

**Final Example**: A healthcare provider:
- Uses **File Gateway** for active patient records (NFS to S3)
- Implements **Volume Gateway** for PACS imaging database (iSCSI to EBS)
- Configures **Tape Gateway** for HIPAA-mandated backups (VTL to Glacier)
- Deploys as VMware VMs across 5 locations
- Achieves 60% storage cost reduction while improving availability
