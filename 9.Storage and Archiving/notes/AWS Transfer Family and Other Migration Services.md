## AWS Transfer Family Overview

**Definition**: The AWS Transfer Family is a suite of fully managed services enabling secure file transfers directly into and out of AWS storage services using standard protocols.

**Supported Protocols**:
- **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
- **FTPS** (FTP over SSL)
- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol)

**Storage Integration**:
- Amazon S3 buckets
- Amazon EFS file systems

**Key Benefits**:
- Maintain existing file transfer workflows
- No need to modify client applications
- Built-in security and compliance features

**Example**: A financial institution migrates from an on-premises SFTP server to AWS Transfer for SFTP, maintaining their existing client connections while gaining S3's scalability.

## Transfer for SFTP

### Core Features:
- **Identity Federation**: Integrates with Active Directory, LDAP, or Okta
- **End-to-End Encryption**: TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
- **Storage Flexibility**: Files stored directly in S3/EFS

### Implementation Example:
```bash
# Create SFTP server
aws transfer create-server \
  --protocols SFTP \
  --identity-provider-type SERVICE_MANAGED \
  --endpoint-type PUBLIC
```

**Configuration Workflow**:
1. Create IAM role for SFTP access
2. Configure security group (port 22)
3. Set up user mappings to S3 prefixes
4. Test connection with FileZilla/WinSCP

**Use Case**: Media company receives daily advertising assets from partners via SFTP, stored directly in S3 for processing.

## AWS DataSync

**Definition**: Online service that automates and accelerates data movement between on-premises and AWS storage.

### Key Features:
- **High Speed**: Up to 10x faster than open-source tools
- **Network Optimization**: Automatic compression and parallel transfer
- **Change Detection**: Only transfers modified files
- **Agent-Based**: Lightweight agent for on-premises deployment

**Architecture**:
```
On-Premises
├── NFS/SMB Share
├── DataSync Agent
│   ├── Direct Connect/VPN
│   └── Internet
└── AWS
    ├── S3 Bucket
    └── EFS File System
```

**Example Command**:
```bash
# Create DataSync task
aws datasync create-task \
  --source-location-arn arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:123456789012:location/loc-12345678 \
  --destination-location-arn arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:123456789012:location/loc-87654321 \
  --name "Daily-Backup" \
  --schedule "cron(0 12 * * ? *)"
```

**Use Case**: Healthcare provider synchronizes patient records nightly from on-premises NAS to Amazon EFS for analytics processing.

## AWS Snow Family

### Product Lineup:
| Service | Capacity | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Snowcone** | 8TB | Edge computing in harsh environments |
| **Snowball Edge** | 80TB | Large-scale data transfers |
| **Snowmobile** | 100PB | Exabyte-scale migrations |

### Key Features:
- **Air-Gapped Security**: Tamper-resistant enclosures
- **Edge Computing**: Run AWS services on-device
- **Chain of Custody**: GPS tracking and audit logs

**Migration Workflow**:
1. Order device through AWS Console
2. Receive and connect to local network
3. Transfer data using Snowball client
4. Return device for AWS import

**Example**: Oil company collects seismic data in remote locations using Snowball Edge with compute capabilities, then ships for cloud processing.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Protocol Flexibility**: Transfer Family supports SFTP/FTPS/FTP without client changes
2. **Migration Speed**: DataSync provides 10x faster transfers than open-source tools
3. **Offline Options**: Snow Family handles petabyte-scale offline migrations
4. **End-to-End Security**: All services feature encryption and access controls
5. **Managed Services**: No infrastructure to maintain with AWS handling scaling and availability

**Implementation Scenario**:
- **Phase 1**: Use Transfer Family for ongoing SFTP uploads to S3
- **Phase 2**: Migrate historical data with DataSync
- **Phase 3**: Transfer 500TB legacy tapes using Snowball Edge
- **Result**: Complete cloud migration with minimal downtime
