## What is Apache Kafka?

An open-source, distributed event streaming platform built to handle large-scale data and scalability.

Event streaming in Kafka involves capturing data from diverse sources, storing it reliably, and delivering it to users/systems as needed.

## Key Use Cases:

* E-commerce: Real-time sales tracking and order status updates (e.g., processing, shipment).

* Ride-Sharing/Delivery Apps: Live location tracking for drivers and customers.

* Sensor Networks: Monitoring data like warehouse temperatures or vehicle safety systems.

* Cybersecurity: Spam detection, patch monitoring, and threat analysis.
