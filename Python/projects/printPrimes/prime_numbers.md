# **Complete Python Program to Print Prime Numbers Between 1 and 250**

This program is designed to print all prime numbers between 1 and 250. It includes a function to check if a number is prime and a loop to iterate through the range of numbers, printing those that are prime.

## **Program Code**

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Check if a number is prime.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False  # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
    if n == 2:
        return True  # 2 is the only even prime number
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False  # Other even numbers are not prime

    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n (only odd numbers)
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False  # If divisible, it's not prime
    return True  # If no divisors found, it's prime


# Print prime numbers between 1 and 250
print("Prime numbers between 1 and 250:")
for x in range(1, 251):  # Loop through numbers 1 to 250
    if is_prime(x):  # Check if the number is prime
        print(x, end=" ")  # Print the prime number
```

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **1. `is_prime` Function**

The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime. Here’s how it works:

#### **a. Handle Edge Cases**
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is **not prime**.
  ```python
  if n <= 1:
      return False
  ```
- If `n` is 2, it is **prime** (2 is the only even prime number).
  ```python
  if n == 2:
      return True
  ```
- If `n` is even and greater than 2, it is **not prime**.
  ```python
  if n % 2 == 0:
      return False
  ```

#### **b. Check for Divisors**
- For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the **square root of `n`**.
  - The square root is used because if `n` has a factor greater than its square root, the corresponding factor must be less than the square root.
  - Only odd numbers are checked because even numbers (other than 2) are already handled.
  ```python
  for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
      if n % i == 0:
          return False
  ```

#### **c. Return True if No Divisors Found**
- If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
  ```python
  return True
  ```

### **2. Main Program**

The main part of the program iterates through numbers from 1 to 250 and prints those that are prime.

#### **a. Loop Through Numbers 1 to 250**
- The `range(1, 251)` generates numbers from 1 to 250 (inclusive).
  ```python
  for x in range(1, 251):
  ```

#### **b. Check if the Number is Prime**
- For each number `x`, call the `is_prime` function.
  ```python
  if is_prime(x):
  ```

#### **c. Print the Prime Number**
- If the number is prime, print it.
  ```python
  print(x, end=" ")
  ```

## **Output of the Program**

When you run the program, the output will be:

```
Prime numbers between 1 and 250:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149 151 157 163 167 173 179 181 191 193 197 199 211 223 227 229 233 239 241
```

## **Why This Program Works**

1. **Efficiency**:
   - The program skips even numbers after checking for 2, reducing the number of iterations.
   - It only checks divisibility up to the square root of the number, which significantly reduces the number of checks.

2. **Correctness**:
   - The edge cases (numbers ≤ 1, 2, and even numbers) are handled explicitly.
   - The divisibility check ensures that only numbers with no divisors other than 1 and themselves are classified as prime.

---

## **Mathematical Reasoning**

### **Why Check Up to the Square Root?**

If a number `n` is not prime, it can be factored into two numbers `a` and `b` such that:
\[ n = a \times b \]

If both `a` and `b` are greater than the square root of `n`, then:
\[ a \times b > \sqrt{n} \times \sqrt{n} = n \]

This is a contradiction, so at least one of the factors must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. Therefore, we only need to check divisibility up to the square root.

## **Conclusion**

This Python program efficiently prints all prime numbers between 1 and 250. It uses a combination of edge-case handling, mathematical optimization, and a clear loop structure to achieve the desired result. The `is_prime` function is reusable and can be adapted for other ranges or applications.
