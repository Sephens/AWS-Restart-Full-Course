# AWS re/Start - Configuration Management & Python Fundamentals

Below is a comprehensive markdown document covering all content from the Configuration Management module, with detailed explanations, practical examples, and additional insights.

---

## Module Overview
**Title**: Configuration Management  
**Subtitle**: Python Fundamentals  


---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will learn how to:
1. Define project infrastructure
2. Explain why project infrastructure is critical for project success
3. Define the purpose and function of software configuration management

---

## Project Infrastructure

### Definition
Project infrastructure refers to how a project is organized structurally. Just as an architect organizes the physical infrastructure of a bridge, software developers organize the logical infrastructure of code.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Good Infrastructure**: Multiple teams work cohesively with standardized processes
- **Bad Infrastructure**: Teams work in silos without coordination

**Example**:  
Imagine building a web application:
- Good: Frontend, backend, and DevOps teams use shared coding standards and CI/CD pipelines
- Bad: Each team uses different indentation styles, testing frameworks, and deployment methods

### Traditional Project Infrastructure
In traditional setups:
1. Each team creates their own DevOps automation processes
2. Eventually, one team consolidates these into a single process
3. Final testing occurs before release

**Problems**:
- Tedious reconciliation of different approaches
- Inefficient use of resources
- Higher chance of integration issues

---

## Code Organization

### Importance of Consistent Style
- Companies enforce coding standards for:
  - Variable naming conventions (e.g., `snake_case` vs `camelCase`)
  - Indentation (spaces vs tabs, typically 4 spaces in Python)
  - Import ordering
  - Documentation standards

**Why It Matters**:
```python
# Bad: Inconsistent styles mixed
def calculateTotal(price, tax):
    final_price = price*(1+tax)
    return final_price

# Good: PEP 8 compliant
def calculate_total(price, tax):
    final_price = price * (1 + tax)
    return final_price
```

### Testing Standards
- Single set of tests for all teams
- Includes:
  - Logic tests (unit tests)
  - Compilation checks
  - Integration tests

---

## Tools and Templates

### Style Enforcement
**pylint** - Static code analyzer that checks for:
- Syntax errors
- Style violations (PEP 8)
- Potential bugs

**Example Usage**:
```bash
pylint my_script.py
```

**Sample Output**:
```
************* Module my_script
C:  1, 0: Missing module docstring (missing-docstring)
C:  1, 0: Constant name "x" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE style (invalid-name)
```

### Testing Tools
**pytest** - Testing framework that:
- Discovers and runs tests
- Provides rich assertion introspection
- Supports fixtures for test setup/teardown

**Example Test**:
```python
# test_calculations.py
def test_calculate_total():
    from myapp import calculate_total
    assert calculate_total(100, 0.1) == 110
```

Run with:
```bash
pytest test_calculations.py
```

## Software Configuration Management (SCM)

### Definition
SCM is a systems engineering process for:
- Tracking code versions
- Enabling parallel development
- Facilitating change merging
- Allowing rollbacks

**Key Components**:
1. Version Control (e.g., Git)
2. Change Management
3. Release Management

### How SCM Works
1. **Checkout**: Developers get code from repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
   ```
2. **Modify**: Make changes locally
3. **Commit**: Save changes with message
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fixed login validation bug"
   ```
4. **Push**: Upload changes
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
5. **Merge**: Integrate changes after review

### Version Control Systems
| Feature       | Git | AWS CodeCommit | GitHub |
|--------------|-----|---------------|--------|
| Hosting      | Local | Cloud (AWS) | Cloud |
| Access Control | Basic | IAM Integrated | GitHub ACLs |
| CI/CD Integration | Manual | CodePipeline | GitHub Actions |

## Configuration Management in Practice

### Versioning
Software versions typically follow Semantic Versioning:
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`  
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible features
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

**Example Release Process**:
1. Develop features in `feature/` branches
2. Merge to `develop` branch for testing
3. Create release branch `release/1.2.0`
4. After validation, merge to `main` and tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
   git push origin v1.2.0
   ```

### Accounting and Security
- **Audit Trails**: Git logs show:
  - Who made changes
  - When changes were made
  - What changed (via `git diff`)
  
**Example Audit Command**:
```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
```

- **Access Control**:
  - SSH keys for authentication
  - Branch protection rules
  - Code review requirements

## Key Takeaways

1. **Project Infrastructure**:
   - Critical for team coordination
   - Requires standardization across teams

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Enforced through style guides (`pylint`)
   - Validated through testing (`pytest`)

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Git is the fundamental tool
   - Enables:
     - Version control
     - Parallel development
     - Change tracking
     - Rollback capability

4. **Security**:
   - Access-controlled repositories
   - Comprehensive audit logs

5. **Tool Integration**:
   - Can be used via:
     - Command line (Git)
     - IDEs (PyCharm, VS Code)
     - CI/CD pipelines

## Practical Exercise

1. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_project
   cd my_project
   git init
   ```

2. Create a Python file with intentional style violations:
   ```python
   # bad_style.py
   def BadFunction(x):
   return x*2
   ```

3. Run pylint:
   ```bash
   pylint bad_style.py
   ```

4. Fix the issues and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixed style issues per pylint"
   ```

5. Write a test with pytest:
   ```python
   # test_operations.py
   from bad_style import BadFunction

   def test_doubling():
       assert BadFunction(2) == 4
   ```

6. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
