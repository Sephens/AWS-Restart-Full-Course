## Debugging Fundamentals

### What is Debugging?
Debugging is the process of:
1. **Identifying defects** in code
2. **Fixing those defects**

**Example Scenario**:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)  # Potential ZeroDivisionError
```

### Python Debugger (PDB)
The built-in Python debugger allows line-by-line execution and inspection.

**Basic Commands**:
| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `n` | Next line |
| `s` | Step into function |
| `c` | Continue until breakpoint |
| `p <var>` | Print variable value |
| `q` | Quit debugger |

**Example Usage**:
```bash
python -m pdb my_script.py
```

## Static Analysis

### Definition
Analysis performed **without executing code**:
- Syntax checking
- Code style validation
- Complexity analysis

**Tools**:
1. **Python Interpreter**: Basic syntax checking
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile script.py
   ```
2. **IDEs**: Real-time error detection (PyCharm, VS Code)
3. **Linters**: `pylint`, `flake8`, `mypy`

**Example Pylint Output**:
```
************* Module example
C:  5, 0: Missing function docstring (missing-docstring)
C:  5, 4: Argument name "x" doesn't conform to snake_case (invalid-name)
```

### Advantages vs Disadvantages
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Early bug detection | False positives |
| Consistent code style | Time-consuming manual review |
| Catches syntax errors | Limited to visible code |

---

## Dynamic Analysis

### Definition
Analysis performed **during code execution**:
- Runtime error detection
- Performance monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

**Techniques**:
1. **Debugging Mode**: Step-through execution
2. **Assertions**: Runtime condition checks
   ```python
   def process_age(age):
       assert age > 0, "Age must be positive"
       return age * 2
   ```
3. **Logging**: Runtime event recording

**Logging Example**:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.DEBUG)

def divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        logging.error(f"Division by zero: {e}")
        raise
    return result
```

### Advantages vs Disadvantages
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Real-world behavior | Resource intensive |
| Catches runtime errors | Difficult to reproduce issues |
| Works with compiled code | Incomplete coverage |

## Software Testing Hierarchy

### Testing Pyramid
1. **Unit Tests** (70%)
   - Test individual components
   - Fast execution
   - Example: `unittest`, `pytest`
   
   ```python
   # test_calculator.py
   def test_addition():
       assert add(2, 3) == 5
   ```

2. **Integration Tests** (20%)
   - Test component interactions
   - Medium execution speed
   - Example: Database + API tests

3. **System Tests** (8%)
   - Full system validation
   - Slow execution
   - Example: End-to-end UI tests

4. **Acceptance Tests** (2%)
   - Business requirement validation
   - Very slow
   - Example: User acceptance testing (UAT)

## Practical Demonstrations

### Static Debugging Exercise
1. Create `debug.py`:
   ```python
   # Contains two errors
   var = "Double Value"
   sumvalue = var + 4  # TypeError

   def dosomething(valuetocheck):
       if valuetocheck > 4:
       print("Bad indent")  # IndentationError
   ```

2. Run and analyze errors:
   ```bash
   python debug.py
   ```

### Dynamic Debugging Exercise
1. Modify `debug.py`:
   ```python
   def checkvalue(valuetocheck):
       assert type(valuetocheck) is int, "Must enter a number"
       assert valuetocheck > 0, "Value must be > 0"
       if valuetocheck > 4:
           print("Value > 4")

   var = int(input("Enter number > 0: "))
   checkvalue(var)
   ```

2. Test with various inputs:
   ```bash
   python debug.py
   ```

## Logging Best Practices

### What to Log
| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Errors | Exceptions, stack traces |
| Events | User logins, transactions |
| Performance | Execution times, memory usage |
| System | Startup/shutdown events |

### Python Logging Levels
| Level | When to Use |
|-------|------------|
| DEBUG | Diagnostic information |
| INFO | Confirmation messages |
| WARNING | Potential issues |
| ERROR | Serious problems |
| CRITICAL | Application failure |

**Configuration Example**:
```python
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='app.log',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
```

## Checkpoint Questions & Answers

1. **What is the purpose of debugging?**  
   Debugging enables developers to identify and fix logic errors in code, ensuring correct program behavior.

2. **Why learn PDB?**  
   PDB provides granular control over code execution, allowing inspection of variables and program state at specific points.

3. **Static vs dynamic for small programs?**  
   Static analysis is typically more effective for small programs as the entire codebase can be easily reviewed for errors.

4. **Unit vs integration tests?**  
   - Unit tests verify individual components in isolation  
   - Integration tests verify interactions between components

## Key Takeaways

1. **Debugging Techniques**:
   - Use PDB for step-by-step execution
   - Combine static and dynamic analysis
   - Implement comprehensive logging

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Follow the testing pyramid (70/20/8/2 rule)
   - Automate where possible (CI/CD pipelines)
   - Validate at all levels (unit to acceptance)

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Log meaningful events with proper context
   - Use assertions for critical conditions
   - Maintain consistent coding standards

4. **Tool Ecosystem**:
