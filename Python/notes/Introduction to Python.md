**Key Characteristics:**
- Interpreted language (no compilation needed)
- Dynamically typed
- Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, functional)
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Why Use Python?

### Advantages of Python:
1. **Easy to Learn**: Simple syntax resembling natural language
2. **Versatile**: Supports multiple programming styles
3. **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: Vast collection of libraries and frameworks
5. **Community Support**: Large active developer community
6. **Rapid Development**: Quick prototyping and iteration

**Example: Simple Python vs Java**
```python
# Python
print("Hello World")
```
```java
// Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

## Python Development Environments
Python code can be written in any text editor, but specialized tools enhance productivity.

### Common Development Tools:
| Tool | Type | Features |
|------|------|----------|
| Visual Studio Code | Editor/IDE | Lightweight, extensions |
| PyCharm | IDE | Python-specific, professional features |
| AWS Cloud9 | Cloud IDE | Browser-based, collaborative |
| Vim/Neovim | Text Editor | Lightweight, keyboard-centric |
| Spyder | IDE | Scientific computing focus |

**Basic Workflow:**
1. Write code in editor/IDE
2. Save with `.py` extension
3. Run with Python interpreter: `python script.py`

---

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
IDEs provide comprehensive facilities for software development.

### Core IDE Features:
1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-coded code elements
2. **Code Completion**: Intelligent suggestions
3. **Debugging**: Step-through execution, breakpoints
4. **Version Control**: Git integration
5. **Project Management**: File organization tools

**Example: Debugging in IDE**
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    return total / len(numbers)  # Breakpoint here

scores = [85, 90, 78, 92]
average = calculate_average(scores)
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

---

## AWS Cloud9 IDE
AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE that enables development directly in a browser.

### Key Features:
- **Browser-Based**: No local installation needed
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple developers can edit simultaneously
- **Preconfigured Environments**: Python, Node.js, Ruby, etc.
- **Serverless Integration**: Direct AWS Lambda development
- **Terminal Access**: Full Linux shell

**Example Cloud9 Workflow:**
1. Create new environment in AWS Console
2. Write Python code in browser interface
3. Run/debug directly in Cloud9
4. Deploy to AWS services like Lambda

---

## Running Python Applications
Python applications can be executed in various ways:

### Execution Methods:
1. **Local Execution**:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
2. **IDE Execution**: Run button in development environment
3. **Cloud Deployment**: AWS Lambda, EC2, etc.
4. **Web Frameworks**: Django, Flask for web applications

**Scaling Considerations:**
- For global availability: Cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- For high traffic: Load balancing, auto-scaling
- For serverless: AWS Lambda

---

## AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.

### Lambda Characteristics:
- **Event-Driven**: Triggers from S3, API Gateway, etc.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles varying workloads
- **Pay-Per-Use**: Charges only for compute time
- **Multi-Language**: Supports Python, Node.js, Java, etc.

**Example Lambda Use Case: Image Processing**
1. User uploads image to S3 bucket
2. S3 event triggers Lambda function
3. Lambda processes image (resizing, analysis)
4. Results stored back in S3 or database

**Sample Lambda Handler (Python):**
```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Process S3 upload event
    print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event))
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Processing complete!')
    }
```

## Shell Scripting vs Python

### Comparison Table:
| Feature | Shell Scripting | Python |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Syntax Complexity | Simple commands | More structured |
| Data Structures | Limited | Rich (lists, dicts, etc.) |
| Portability | OS-dependent | Cross-platform |
| Development Speed | Fast for simple tasks | Better for complex logic |
| Maintenance | Harder for complex scripts | Easier with proper structure |

**Example: HTTP Server**
```bash
# Bash (requires additional tools)
python -m http.server 8000
```
```python
# Python (built-in)
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

def run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    server_address = ('', 8000)
    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
    httpd.serve_forever()

run()
```

## Checkpoint Questions and Answers

1. **Does Python use an interpreter or a compiler?**
   - Python uses an interpreter, which executes code line-by-line rather than compiling the entire program beforehand.

2. **What is a use case for shell scripting?**
   - System administration tasks like log rotation, backups, or monitoring disk space. Example: A script that alerts when disk usage exceeds 90%.

3. **True or false: Python is only a functional programming language.**
   - False. Python supports multiple paradigms including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles.

4. **What does the acronym IDE stand for?**
   - Integrated Development Environment - a software suite that consolidates tools for coding, debugging, and testing.

5. **Name at least two different IDEs that you can use to write Python code.**
   - PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, AWS Cloud9, Spyder, Eclipse with PyDev.

---

## Key Takeaways
1. **Python's Strengths**: Simple syntax, versatility, and extensive libraries make Python ideal for beginners and experts alike.
2. **Development Tools**: While any text editor works, IDEs like PyCharm and AWS Cloud9 significantly boost productivity.
3. **Cloud Development**: AWS Cloud9 enables collaborative, browser-based Python development with AWS integration.
4. **Serverless Computing**: AWS Lambda allows running Python code without managing servers, scaling automatically.
5. **Scripting Choice**: For simple system tasks use shell scripts; for complex logic or cross-platform needs use Python.

## Additional Notes and Examples

### Python Paradigm Examples:

**Procedural Style:**
```python
def calculate_tax(income):
    if income <= 10000:
        return income * 0.1
    else:
        return 1000 + (income - 10000) * 0.2
```

**Object-Oriented Style:**
```python
class TaxCalculator:
    def __init__(self, income):
        self.income = income
    
    def calculate(self):
        if self.income <= 10000:
            return self.income * 0.1
        else:
            return 1000 + (self.income - 10000) * 0.2
```

**Functional Style:**
```python
from functools import reduce

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
sum_squared = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, squared)
```

### AWS Cloud9 Collaboration Demo:
1. Developer A creates environment and shares via AWS Console
2. Developer B joins via invitation link
3. Both see real-time edits with colored cursors
4. Simultaneous debugging and terminal access

### Lambda Advanced Example:
```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Initialize S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # Get uploaded file information
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Process file
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
    content = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')
    line_count = len(content.split('\n'))
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': f'File {key} has {line_count} lines'
    }
```
