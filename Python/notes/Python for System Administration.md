## System Administration Defined
System administration (SysAdmin) involves managing hardware and software systems to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

### Common SysAdmin Tasks:
1. **User Management**:
   - Creating/deleting user accounts
   - Managing user permissions
   - Handling group memberships

2. **Package Management**:
   - Installing/removing software
   - Updating systems
   - Cleaning up unused packages

3. **System Maintenance**:
   - Monitoring system health
   - Performing backups
   - Troubleshooting issues

4. **Automation**:
   - Scheduling routine tasks
   - Automating repetitive processes
   - Creating maintenance scripts

---

## Benefits of System Administration
Effective system administration provides several key benefits:

1. **Increased Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual work
2. **Proactive Problem Solving**: Identifies issues before they affect users
3. **System Stability**: Maintains consistent performance
4. **Security**: Ensures proper access controls and updates
5. **Cost Savings**: Reduces downtime and manual labor

**Example**: A Python script that automatically monitors disk space and alerts when it's low can prevent system crashes.

## Managing Users with Python
Python can automate user management tasks through system command execution.

### 1. Adding Users
```python
import os

def add_user():
    confirm = "N"
    while confirm != "Y":
        username = input("Enter username to add: ")
        print(f"Use username '{username}'? (Y/N)")
        confirm = input().upper()
    os.system(f"sudo useradd {username}")
    print(f"User {username} added successfully")

add_user()
```

### 2. Removing Users
```python
def remove_user():
    confirm = "N"
    while confirm != "Y":
        username = input("Enter username to remove: ")
        print(f"Remove user '{username}'? (Y/N)")
        confirm = input().upper()
    os.system(f"sudo userdel -r {username}")
    print(f"User {username} removed")

remove_user()
```

### 3. Managing Group Memberships
```python
import subprocess

def manage_groups():
    username = input("Enter username: ")
    
    # Get available groups
    groups = subprocess.run(['groups'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    print(f"Available groups:\n{groups.stdout.decode()}")
    
    # Add to groups
    group_list = input("Enter groups to add (space-separated): ").split()
    for group in group_list:
        subprocess.run(['sudo', 'usermod', '-aG', group, username])
    
    print(f"User {username} added to groups: {', '.join(group_list)}")

manage_groups()
```

---

## Package Management with Python
Python scripts can handle package installation, removal, and system updates.

### 1. Package Installation/Removal
```python
import os

def package_manager():
    action = ""
    while action not in ["I", "R"]:
        action = input("Install or Remove packages? (I/R): ").upper()
    
    packages = input("Enter package names (space-separated): ")
    
    if action == "I":
        os.system(f"sudo apt-get install -y {packages}")
    else:
        purge = input("Purge files? (Y/N): ").upper()
        if purge == "Y":
            os.system(f"sudo apt-get purge -y {packages}")
        else:
            os.system(f"sudo apt-get remove -y {packages}")

package_manager()
```

### 2. System Updates
```python
def system_update():
    os.system("sudo apt-get update")
    os.system("sudo apt-get upgrade -y")
    os.system("sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y")
    print("System updated successfully")

system_update()
```

### 3. Cleaning the System
```python
def clean_system():
    os.system("sudo apt-get autoremove -y")
    os.system("sudo apt-get autoclean")
    print("System cleaned successfully")

clean_system()
```

---

## Executing System Commands
Python provides multiple ways to execute system commands, each with different features.

### 1. `os.system()` (Basic)
```python
import os
# Simple command execution
os.system("ls -l")
# Returns exit status (0 for success)
```

### 2. `subprocess.run()` (Recommended)
```python
import subprocess

# Basic usage
result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout)

# With error handling
try:
    subprocess.run(["sudo", "apt-get", "update"], check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Command failed: {e}")
```

### Comparison Table:
| Feature | `os.system()` | `subprocess.run()` |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| Output Capture | No | Yes |
| Error Handling | Basic | Advanced |
| Security | Less secure | More secure |
| Command Format | String | List preferred |
| Return Value | Exit status | CompletedProcess object |
| Python Version | All | 3.5+ recommended |

**Best Practice**: Use `subprocess.run()` with a list of arguments for better security and control.

## Additional Notes and Examples

### Advanced User Management Example:
```python
import subprocess
import getpass

def create_user_with_home():
    username = input("Enter new username: ")
    password = getpass.getpass("Enter password: ")
    
    try:
        # Create user with home directory
        subprocess.run(
            ['sudo', 'useradd', '-m', '-s', '/bin/bash', username],
            check=True
        )
        
        # Set password
        subprocess.run(
            ['sudo', 'chpasswd'],
            input=f"{username}:{password}",
            text=True,
            check=True
        )
        
        print(f"User {username} created successfully")
        
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error creating user: {e}")

create_user_with_home()
```

### Secure Package Management:
```python
import subprocess

def safe_package_install(packages):
    if not isinstance(packages, list):
        packages = packages.split()
    
    try:
        subprocess.run(
            ['sudo', 'apt-get', 'install', '-y'] + packages,
            check=True,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE
        )
        print("Packages installed successfully")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Installation failed: {e.stderr.decode()}")

safe_package_install(["nginx", "python3-pip"])
```

### Comprehensive System Monitor:
```python
import subprocess
import shlex
import time

def system_monitor():
    while True:
        # Check disk space
        disk = subprocess.run(
            shlex.split("df -h /"),
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        print(disk.stdout)
        
        # Check running processes
        top = subprocess.run(
            ["top", "-bn1"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        print(top.stdout.split('\n')[0:5])  # Show header and top processes
        
        time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes

try:
    system_monitor()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Monitoring stopped")
```

### Best Practices for SysAdmin Scripts:
1. **Validation**: Always validate user input to prevent command injection
2. **Logging**: Implement logging for troubleshooting
3. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks for robust error handling
4. **Modularity**: Break scripts into functions for reusability
5. **Documentation**: Include comments and docstrings
6. **Testing**: Test scripts in a safe environment before production use
