## Challenge Overview
This challenge demonstrates how to predict instance count changes in an Auto Scaling group based on CPU utilization metrics and scaling policies. The goal is to understand how scaling policies interact with real-world workload patterns and warmup periods.

**Business Case**: A streaming service needs to handle variable loads during peak viewing hours while minimizing costs during off-peak times.

---

## Initial Configuration
The Auto Scaling group is configured with:
- **Maximum capacity**: 20 instances
- **Desired capacity**: 10 instances
- **Minimum capacity**: 5 instances

**Visualization**:

```

**Scaling Policy Types**:
- Scale-out: Add instances when CPU utilization is high
- Scale-in: Remove instances when CPU utilization is low

---

## Step Scaling Policy Rules
The scaling policies are triggered based on average CPU utilization over 2-minute periods:

| CPU Utilization Range | Scaling Action           | Example Scenario                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 80-100%               | Add 2 instances          | Black Friday sale traffic spike      |
| 60-80%                | Add 1 instance           | Weekly product launch                |
| 40-20%                | Remove 1 instance        | Nighttime maintenance window         |
| 20-0%                 | Remove 2 instances       | System shutdown after business hours |

**Special Consideration**: 5-minute instance warmup period means new instances aren't immediately counted in capacity calculations.

## Condition Analysis

### Condition #1: CPU at 63-70% for >2 minutes
- **Policy Trigger**: Add 1 instance (60-80% range)
- **Warmup Impact**: Instance added but not counted for 5 minutes
- **Current Capacity**: Still shows 10 instances during warmup
- **Real-world Analog**: Gradual morning traffic increase on a news site

### Condition #2: CPU remains 60-80% after 2 minutes
- **Policy Trigger**: Would add another instance
- **Warmup Constraint**: No addition due to ongoing warmup
- **System Behavior**: Queueing policy actions during warmup
- **Example**: Secondary traffic surge while first scaling is processing

### Condition #3: CPU spikes to 85% during warmup
- **Policy Trigger**: Add 2 instances (80-100% range)
- **Warmup Adjustment**: Only 1 added (1 already warming up)
- **Capacity Calculation**: 10 (current) + 1 (warming) + 1 (new) = 12 total
- **Use Case**: Unexpected viral content sharing during scaling

### Condition #4: CPU drops to 53% with instances warming
- **Policy Evaluation**: No action (53% between 40-60% dead zone)
- **System State**: First instance now active, second still warming
- **Business Scenario**: Flash sale ends but residual traffic remains

### Condition #5: CPU at steady 32%
- **Policy Trigger**: Remove 1 instance (20-40% range)
- **Action Delay**: 2-minute threshold must be met
- **Result**: Group reduces from 12 → 11 instances
- **Example**: Post-lunch hour traffic decline

### Condition #6: CPU drops to 17%
- **Policy Trigger**: Remove 2 instances (0-20% range)
- **Final Count**: 11 → 9 instances
- **Cost Impact**: 30% reduction in running instances
- **Real-world Case**: Overnight infrastructure scaling down

## Key Takeaways

1. **Warmup Periods Matter**:
   - New instances don't immediately affect capacity calculations
   - Multiple scaling events may queue during warmup
   - *Best Practice*: Set warmup periods matching your application bootstrap time

2. **Policy Threshold Design**:
   - 40-60% range creates a buffer zone preventing thrashing
   - Multiple step adjustments allow granular response
   - *Example Improvement*: Add 75-85% intermediate step

3. **Time Delays Are Cumulative**:
   - 2-minute metric evaluation + 5-minute warmup = 7-minute full response
   - *Critical Consideration*: May need predictive scaling for faster responses

4. **Instance Counting Logic**:
   ```python
   def calculate_effective_capacity(current, warming):
       return current + sum(1 for w in warming if w['time_remaining'] <= 0)
   ```

## Practical Applications

### Video Streaming Platform
- **Morning**: Gradual scale-out (Conditions 1-3)
- **Prime Time**: Maximum capacity (20 instances)
- **Late Night**: Aggressive scale-in (Conditions 5-6)
- **Cost Savings**: 55% reduction (20 → 9 instances) during off-peak

### E-commerce Implementation

    A[CPU > 80%] -->|Add 2| B[Check warmup]
    B --> C{Instances warming?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Add (2 - warming)]
    C -->|No| E[Add 2]
    F[CPU < 20%] --> G[Remove 2]
```

**Monitoring Recommendations**:
1. CloudWatch alarms at 55% and 75% for early warning
2. Predictive scaling for known traffic patterns
3. Weekly policy reviews using AWS Auto Scaling history

**Advanced Consideration**: Combine with Spot Instances for additional cost savings during scale-out events.
