## Introduction to Scaling

Scaling is a critical concept in cloud computing, allowing systems to adjust their compute capacity based on fluctuating demand. In traditional data centers, scaling is limited by physical hardware, but in the cloud, resources can be dynamically adjusted to meet demand.

### Example:
Consider a tax preparation business in the U.S. Traffic spikes around the tax filing deadline (April 15). In a traditional data center, you would need to provision enough servers to handle this peak traffic, leaving them idle for the rest of the year. In the cloud, you can scale out (add resources) during peak times and scale in (remove resources) when demand decreases, optimizing costs and performance.

---

## What is Scaling?

Scaling refers to the ability to increase or decrease compute capacity to meet demand. There are two main types of scaling:

- **Scale Out**: Adding more resources (e.g., EC2 instances) when demand increases.
- **Scale In**: Removing resources when demand decreases.

Scaling can be done manually or automatically using **Auto Scaling**. Auto Scaling ensures that you have the right number of instances to handle your application's load, optimizing both performance and cost.

### Example:
If your application experiences a sudden spike in traffic (e.g., during a flash sale), Auto Scaling can automatically add more EC2 instances to handle the load. Once the traffic subsides, it can terminate the extra instances to save costs.

---

## Benefits of Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling provides several key benefits:

1. **Fault Tolerance**: Auto Scaling can detect unhealthy instances, terminate them, and launch new ones to replace them. It can also distribute instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
2. **High Availability**: Ensures your application always has the right amount of capacity to handle traffic.
3. **Performance**: More instances mean better distribution of workloads, maintaining good response times.
4. **Cost Optimization**: You only pay for the resources you use. Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts capacity, saving money by terminating unused instances.

### Example:
If an EC2 instance fails, Auto Scaling can automatically replace it, ensuring your application remains available. Additionally, by distributing instances across multiple AZs, your application can withstand AZ failures.

## Components for Scaling

To implement a scalable architecture on AWS, you need the following components:

1. **Amazon Route 53**: A scalable DNS service that routes users to your application.
2. **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (e.g., EC2 instances).
3. **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Groups**: A collection of EC2 instances that can scale up or down based on demand.

### Example:
- **Route 53** translates domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) into IP addresses and routes traffic to an ELB.
- **ELB** distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.
- **Auto Scaling** ensures the right number of instances are running to handle the load.

## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Service

ELB is a key service for scaling in AWS. It automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (e.g., EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) and monitors the health of those targets.

### Key Features of ELB:
- **High Availability (HA)**: Distributes traffic across multiple AZs.
- **Health Checks**: Detects unhealthy targets and stops sending traffic to them.
- **Security**: Supports security groups and TLS termination.
- **Layer 4 (Transport) and Layer 7 (Application) Load Balancing**: Supports both TCP and HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- **Operational Monitoring**: Integrates with Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.

### Example:
If an EC2 instance becomes unhealthy, ELB stops sending traffic to it and redistributes the load to healthy instances. This ensures that your application remains available and responsive.

## Types of ELB Load Balancers

AWS offers four types of load balancers, each designed for specific use cases:

### 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Layer**: Application layer (Layer 7).
- **Use Case**: Advanced load balancing for HTTP, HTTPS, and gRPC traffic.
- **Features**:
  - Path-based and host-based routing.
  - Native IPv6 support.
  - Dynamic ports for multiple services on the same instance.
  - Enhanced metrics and access logs.

#### Example:
An e-commerce website can use an ALB to route traffic to different microservices based on the URL path (e.g., `/cart` routes to the cart service, `/search` routes to the search service).

### 2. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
- **Layer**: Network layer (Layer 3) and transport layer (Layer 4).
- **Use Case**: Load balancing for virtual appliances and network traffic.
- **Features**:
  - Passes all Layer 3 traffic through third-party virtual appliances.
  - Supports IP protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
  - Provides deletion protection and request tracking.

#### Example:
A security appliance (e.g., firewall) can be deployed behind a GWLB to inspect all incoming traffic before it reaches the application.

### 3. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- **Layer**: Transport layer (Layer 4).
- **Use Case**: High-performance load balancing for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.
- **Features**:
  - Handles millions of requests per second.
  - Single static IP address per AZ.
  - Optimized for sudden and volatile traffic patterns.

#### Example:
A gaming application that requires low latency and high throughput can use an NLB to handle millions of concurrent connections.

### 4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
- **Layer**: Both application (Layer 7) and transport (Layer 4) layers.
- **Use Case**: Basic load balancing for legacy applications on the EC2-Classic platform.
- **Features**:
  - Supports TCP and SSL listeners.
  - Provides sticky sessions using application-generated cookies.

#### Example:
A legacy application running on the EC2-Classic platform can use a CLB for basic load balancing. However, AWS is retiring EC2-Classic, so new applications should use ALB or NLB.

## Checkpoint Questions

1. **Which ELB load balancer would be appropriate for a website?**
   - **Answer**: An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is appropriate for websites because it supports HTTP/HTTPS traffic and provides advanced routing features.

2. **A developer must select a load balancer to handle traffic to a new application. The application could potentially receive hundreds of thousands of requests per second. Often, the requests will come in sudden bursts. Why is the Network Load Balancer a good choice?**
   - **Answer**: The **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is optimized for handling millions of requests per second with low latency, making it ideal for applications with sudden traffic bursts.

3. **Which services support the implementation of scaling in the AWS Cloud?**
   - **Answer**: **Amazon Route 53**, **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**, and **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** support scaling in the AWS Cloud.

## Key Ideas

- **ELB** is a load balancing service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets.
- **ELB offers four types of load balancers**:
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: For HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
  - **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**: For virtual appliances and network traffic.
  - **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: For high-performance TCP/UDP traffic.
  - **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**: For legacy EC2-Classic applications.
- **ELB provides monitoring tools** like health checks, CloudWatch metrics, and access logs to ensure optimal performance.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Scaling in the Cloud**: Unlike traditional data centers, cloud computing allows for dynamic scaling. You can programmatically add or remove resources based on demand, ensuring cost efficiency and high availability.
- **Health Checks**: ELB continuously monitors the health of your instances. If an instance fails a health check, ELB stops sending traffic to it and replaces it with a healthy instance.
- **Cost Management**: By using Auto Scaling and ELB, you only pay for the resources you use. This is particularly beneficial for applications with variable traffic patterns.

### Example:
A video streaming service can use Auto Scaling to handle traffic spikes during popular events (e.g., live sports). ELB ensures that traffic is evenly distributed across healthy instances, while Auto Scaling adds more instances during peak times and removes them when traffic decreases.
