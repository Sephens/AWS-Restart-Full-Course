# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Review

## What You Will Learn

### At the Core of This Lesson
You will learn how to:
- Define **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.
- Recall the types of security credentials and the concepts of IAM users and IAM roles.
- Describe IAM best practices.

---

## IAM Overview

### What is IAM?
- **IAM** is a service that helps securely control access to AWS resources.
- It allows you to manage **authentication** (who can access) and **authorization** (what they can do).

### Key Features of IAM
- **Centralized Management:** Manage access to AWS resources centrally.
- **Users, Groups, and Roles:** Create and manage IAM users, groups, and roles.
- **Policies:** Apply policies to control access to resources.

**Example:**
- Use IAM to control who can terminate EC2 instances or access S3 buckets.

---

## Access to AWS Services

### Programmatic Access
- **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:** Used for programmatic access via AWS CLI, SDKs, and APIs.
- **AWS CLI Example:**
  ```bash
  $ aws configure
  ```

### Console Access
- **IAM User Name and Password:** Used for accessing the AWS Management Console.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security.

**Example:**
- Enable MFA for IAM users to secure console access.

## Types of Security Credentials

| Type of Credentials | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Email and Password** | Associated with the AWS account root user. |
| **IAM User Name and Password** | Used for console access. |
| **Access Keys** | Used for programmatic access (AWS CLI, SDKs). |
| **MFA** | Adds an extra layer of security. |
| **Key Pairs** | Used for specific services like EC2. |

**Best Practice:**
- Avoid using the root user for daily tasks. Instead, create IAM users with limited permissions.

## Policies and Permissions

### Types of Policies
1. **Identity-Based Policies:** Attached to IAM users, groups, or roles.
2. **Resource-Based Policies:** Attached to resources (e.g., S3 bucket policies).
3. **AWS Organizations SCPs:** Apply permissions boundaries to AWS Organizations.
4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Control access to resources.

**Example IAM Policy:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "MFA-Access",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using IAM Roles

### What are IAM Roles?
- **IAM Roles** allow AWS services or users to temporarily assume permissions.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Cross-account access.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) using SAML 2.0 or OAuth 2.0.

**Example:**
- An EC2 instance can assume a role to access S3 buckets.

---

## IAM Permission Examples

### User-Based Permissions
- **Example:** User Xiulan has Read, Write, and List access to Resource X.

### Resource-Based Permissions
- **Example:** Resource X can be accessed by Carlos, Wang, Efua, and Mateo with varying levels of access.

## IAM Best Practices

1. **Avoid Using Root User:** Use IAM users for daily tasks.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the permissions needed.
3. **Use IAM Roles:** For cross-account access and temporary permissions.
4. **Enable MFA:** For added security.
5. **Rotate Credentials Regularly:** Especially access keys.

**Example:**
- Enable MFA for all IAM users with administrative privileges.

## Checkpoint Questions

1. **True or False:** SysOps professionals can use IAM to configure authorization for users.
   - **Answer:** True.

2. **True or False:** As a best practice, AWS recommends using the root account for everyday tasks.
   - **Answer:** False.

3. **Which option does not represent an IAM identity?**
   - **Answer:** Policy.

---

## Key Ideas

- **IAM Identities:** Users, groups, and roles.
- **Access Methods:** Console, AWS CLI, or programmatically.
- **IAM Policies:** JSON documents that define permissions.
- **Roles:** Allow temporary assumption of permissions.
- **Best Practices:** Avoid root user, use least privilege, enable MFA, and use roles for cross-account access.
