## Introduction to Networking Protocols

A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities in a communications system to transmit information. Protocols can be categorized into:

1. **Transport protocols**: Provide mechanisms for applications to communicate
2. **Application protocols**: Govern specific processes like web browsing or email
3. **Management protocols**: Used to configure and maintain network equipment
4. **Support protocols**: Facilitate and improve network communications

**Example**: When you visit a website, multiple protocols work together:
- DNS resolves the domain name to an IP address
- TCP establishes a connection
- HTTP/HTTPS transfers the webpage data
- SSL/TLS encrypts the communication

## Transport Protocols

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**Characteristics**:
- Connection-oriented protocol (requires handshake)
- Reliable data delivery with error detection/correction
- Sequenced packet delivery
- Flow control mechanisms
- Larger overhead (20-byte header)

**TCP Three-Way Handshake**:
1. SYN: Client sends synchronization packet
2. SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges and synchronizes
3. ACK: Client acknowledges the server's response

**Connection Termination**:
1. FIN: Host initiates connection close
2. FIN-ACK: Other host acknowledges
3. ACK: Final acknowledgment

**Real-world analogy**: Like making a phone call - you establish connection (dial), have a conversation (data transfer), and say goodbye (termination).

**Use cases**:
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP)
- File transfers (FTP)
- Remote access (SSH)

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

**Characteristics**:
- Connectionless protocol (no handshake)
- Minimal overhead (8-byte header)
- No guaranteed delivery or ordering
- Faster than TCP
- No flow control or error recovery

**Real-world analogy**: Like sending a letter - you send it without knowing if it will arrive, and multiple letters might arrive out of order.

**Use cases**:
- Video streaming
- Voice over IP (VoIP)
- Online gaming
- DNS queries
- Live broadcasts

### TCP vs UDP Comparison

| Feature               | TCP                          | UDP                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Connection            | Connection-oriented          | Connectionless               |
| Reliability           | Reliable                     | Unreliable                   |
| Speed                 | Slower                       | Faster                       |
| Header Size           | 20 bytes                     | 8 bytes                      |
| Error Checking        | Yes                          | No                           |
| Flow Control          | Yes                          | No                           |
| Data Ordering         | Guaranteed                   | Not guaranteed               |
| Use Cases             | Web, email, file transfer    | Video, VoIP, live streaming  |

**Technical Note**: TCP is like a registered mail service with delivery confirmation, while UDP is like regular mail where you don't get confirmation of delivery.

## Application Protocols

### HTTP/HTTPS

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**:
- Port 80
- Stateless protocol
- Client-server model
- Request methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

**HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**:
- Port 443
- HTTP over SSL/TLS
- Encrypted communication
- Provides authentication

**URL Structure Example**:
```
https://www.example.com/path/to/resource?query=string#fragment
```
- Protocol: https
- Domain: www.example.com
- Path: /path/to/resource
- Query: ?query=string
- Fragment: #fragment

### SSL/TLS

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**:
- Older standard for encrypted communications
- Deprecated due to vulnerabilities

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)**:
- Current standard (TLS 1.2 or 1.3 recommended)
- Provides:
  - Encryption
  - Authentication
  - Data integrity

**TLS Handshake Process**:
1. Client hello
2. Server hello and certificate
3. Key exchange
4. Secure connection established

**Example**: When you see a padlock icon in your browser, it indicates a successful TLS handshake and encrypted connection.

### Mail Protocols

**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**:
- Port 25 (or 587 for secure)
- Used for sending emails
- Transfers emails between servers

**POP3 (Post Office Protocol)**:
- Port 110 (or 995 for secure)
- Downloads emails to local device
- Typically removes emails from server

**IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**:
- Port 143 (or 993 for secure)
- Synchronizes emails across devices
- Emails remain on server

**Email Flow Example**:
1. Your email client (Outlook) uses SMTP to send email to your provider's server
2. Your provider's server uses SMTP to send to recipient's server
3. Recipient's email client uses IMAP/POP to retrieve the email

### Remote Desktop Protocols

**RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**:
- Port 3389
- Microsoft proprietary
- Provides GUI access to Windows machines
- Encrypted connection

**SSH (Secure Shell)**:
- Port 22
- Provides secure command-line access
- Used primarily for Unix/Linux systems
- Supports tunneling and file transfer

**Example**: System administrators use SSH to remotely manage servers, while help desk technicians might use RDP to assist users.

## Management and Support Protocols

### DNS (Domain Name System)

**Function**:
- Translates domain names to IP addresses
- Hierarchical distributed database
- Uses port 53 (TCP/UDP)

**DNS Resolution Process**:
1. Check local cache
2. Query recursive DNS server
3. Root server -> TLD server -> Authoritative server
4. Return IP address to client

**Example**:
```
nslookup example.com
```
Might return:
```
Name: example.com
Address: 93.184.216.34
```

### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

**Function**:
- Network diagnostics and error reporting
- Used by ping and traceroute
- No port number (operates at network layer)

**Common Messages**:
- Echo request/reply (ping)
- Destination unreachable
- Time exceeded

**Example**:
```
ping google.com
```
Shows round-trip time and packet loss.

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

**Function**:
- Automatically assigns IP configuration
- Uses ports 67 (server) and 68 (client)
- Lease-based system

**DHCP Process (DORA)**:
1. Discover
2. Offer
3. Request
4. Acknowledge

**Assigned Parameters**:
- IP address
- Subnet mask
- Default gateway
- DNS servers

### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

**Function**:
- Transfers files between systems
- Uses port 21 (control) and 20 (data)
- Two modes: Active and passive

**Commands**:
- PUT (upload)
- GET (download)
- LS (list files)

**Security Note**: FTP transmits data in clear text. Use SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP Secure) for encrypted transfers.

## Network Diagnostic Tools

### ping

**Purpose**: Tests basic connectivity
**Example**:
```
ping amazon.com
```
**Output Interpretation**:
- Reply time (latency)
- Packet loss percentage
- TTL (Time To Live)

### traceroute

**Purpose**: Shows path to destination
**Example**:
```
traceroute google.com
```
**Output Interpretation**:
- Each hop shows latency
- Asterisks (*) indicate timeouts
- Helps identify network bottlenecks

### nslookup

**Purpose**: DNS troubleshooting
**Example**:
```
nslookup amazon.com
```
**Output Interpretation**:
- Shows resolved IP addresses
- Can query specific DNS record types

### telnet

**Purpose**: Tests port connectivity
**Example**:
```
telnet example.com 80
```
**Output Interpretation**:
- Blank screen = port open
- Connection failed = port closed/firewalled

### hping3

**Purpose**: Advanced ping with TCP
**Example**:
```
hping3 -S -c 5 -p 80 google.com
```
**Output Interpretation**:
- Shows TCP response times
- Can test specific flags (SYN, ACK)

### mtr

**Purpose**: Combines ping + traceroute
**Example**:
```
mtr google.com
```
**Output Interpretation**:
- Continuous updates
- Shows packet loss per hop

## Checkpoint Questions and Answers

**Q1**: A developer tries to initiate a connection to a company's local FTP server by using its IP address. However, the connection fails. Which procedures can the administrator follow to troubleshoot?

**Answer**:
1. Verify physical connectivity (cables, network interface)
2. Test server connectivity with ping
3. Check if FTP service is running on the server
4. Verify firewall rules allow port 21 (or custom FTP port)
5. Test FTP connection from another machine
6. Check server logs for error messages
